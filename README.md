# Bomber-Friends
This is my **Advanced Programming** final project from **Winter-Spring 2022** at university. It is a Java-based game implemented using the **Swing** framework for the user interface.

Originally, there were plans to develop a multiplayer mode, but this feature was ultimately not completed.

### In-Game View

Here’s a screenshot of the in-game view:

### Gameplay

- **Movement and Actions**: Move using the arrow keys and plant bombs with the space bar. Monsters move randomly.
- **Monsters**: 
  - One of the monsters is an old man called BomberMan who can also plant bombs. Be careful!
  - The other two monsters are Skeletons and Slimes. The difference between Skeletons and Slimes is their speed and health. They will die if their health reaches zero from your bombs or if they hit you. If they hit you, your health decreases by one.
- **Bombs**: Initially, your bombs have only one damage point, but this can be increased by collecting magic boxes.
- **Crates**: 
  - Wooden crates break when close to a bomb.
  - Golden crates turn into silver crates, silver crates turn into bronze crates, and bronze crates become magic boxes when in the range of a bomb explosion.
- **Magic Boxes**: These can grant various upgrades such as:
  - An extra bomb.
  - Increased bomb damage.
  - Increased bomb range.
  - An extra health point.
- **Pause and Unpause**: You can pause the game by pressing `P` and unpause by pressing `P` again.
- **Settings**:
  - You can adjust default settings such as the game’s width and height, as well as the number and type of enemies, in the settings menu.

- **Caution**:
  - Be careful when placing bombs, as the explosion can affect you as well!

Hope you enjoy the game!
